# jira-server-edition-openAPIv3

## About the project
This JIRA openAPIv3 ist created for including the JIRA-API into an 
API-Gateway. As I could not find any OpenAPI descriptions I did 
create one for my project.
I used this documentation:
- [JIRA API 7.6.1](https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/7.6.1/)

## PLEASE NOTE
This API-description is not meant to be the full API or without any mistakes. But anyway
shared to the OpenSource Community, as for my point of view still might saves some time by
not creating the whole API-Description :)

## Your Contribution
If you extend this API-description, or fixing mistakes, please share your work, as others might
also appreciate your work
